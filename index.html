              <b>What are mountains?</b><br>
              A mountain is a large natural elevation of the Earth’s surface that rises prominently above the surrounding land, usually with steep sides and a peak (summit) at the top.<br>
              There are 14 mountains with their height crossing 8,000 meter. Among them 8 mountains are said to be in our home land, Nepal. This is the reason nepal is said to be "Country of Mountains".

          <font size="5" color="black"><b>Mount Everest is the tallest and most majestic mountain on Earth, rising high above the clouds in the great Himalayan range between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. The mountain is famous worldwide for its incredible height of about 8,848 meters, making it a symbol of nature’s strength and beauty. The environment around Mount Everest is extremely harsh, with freezing temperatures, strong winds, and very low oxygen levels, which make climbing the mountain one of the most dangerous challenges in the world. Despite these dangers, thousands of climbers travel each year with the dream of reaching the summit, following routes that require years of preparation, physical fitness, and professional guidance. The region surrounding Mount Everest is also culturally rich, as it is home to the Sherpa communities who have lived in the Himalayas for generations and play an important role in supporting mountaineers. The mountain is not only a geographical wonder but also a symbol of human determination, adventure, and the desire to explore the highest places on our planet. The glaciers, snow-covered peaks, and breathtaking views from the Everest region attract tourists, scientists, and adventurers alike, making it one of the most important natural landmarks in the world.</font></b></p>
